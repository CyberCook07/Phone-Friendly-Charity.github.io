    <h2 class="hook_question">What is the Second Wind Foundation?</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The Second Wind Foundation is a charity that was made to help
        athletes of any age to be able to gain a second wind from any injuries
        that could harm and or potientially end their atheltic career. Every game comes
        with a risk that athletes have to face which is injuries some are more severe than others. The
        most heart renching thing to watch is a atheletes multiple years of hard work and dedication
        go down the drain in an instant due to them moving either too fast, turning too quick, or even doing
        a basic everyday move. 60% of athletes sustained servere injuries just through college and 32% of athletes
        are forced to retire due to injuries.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Second Wind wants to give those athletes a chance to come back better and more powerful.
        We don't want athletes to see these injuries as the end of their career but as a chance to 
        build a story of coming back from devistating injuries better than ever. At Second Wind we want to see
        32% of career ending injuries to athletes drop. It's not fair to the athlete and their time and
        to the sport that they have dedicated their life to practicing and loving.
