            <h2>What is the Second Wind Foundation?</h2>
            <div class="content">
            <p>The Second Wind Foundation is a charity that was made to help
                athletes of any age to be able to gain a second wind from any injuries
                that could harm and or potientially end their atheltic career. Every game comes
                with a risk that athletes have to face which is injuries some are more severe than others. The
                most heart renching thing to watch is a atheletes multiple years of hard work and dedication
                go down the drain in an instant due to them moving either too fast, turning too quick, or even doing
                a basic everyday move. 60% of athletes sustained servere injuries just through college and 32% of athletes
                are forced to retire due to injuries
            </p>
            <p>Second Wind wants to give those athletes a chance to come back better and more powerful
                we don't want athletes to see these injuries as the end of their career but as a chance to 
                build a story of coming back from devistating injuries better than ever. At Second Wind we want to see
                32% of career ending injuries to athletes drop it's not fair to the athlete and their time and
                to the sport that they have dedicated their life to practicing and loving.
